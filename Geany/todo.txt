Hello, Vedrana,
Yes, I am interested in a contract position. Unfortunattely, the number 416-913-4583, that I found in the voice message is not working. I left couple of voice messages at your regular (416) 980-2126.

Thanks,
 Yury

Hello,  
It is about contributing . I am leaving this large feedback цшер the hope that Google team will pay attention. I am a passive contributor. I mean that I am contributing only when Maps suggests me to do it.  Many things related to contributing are confusing, and many things are annoying.   
 1) 


I am doing my best trying to contribute to Maps (when Maps asks me to contribute). Now I am writing this long feedback just to share several negative points that I am periodically experiencing with contributions.

•	Why does Maps redirect to community questions, directly addressed to business owners?

When Google shows the information about found places in the search result, there is an option to "Ask a question or get advice from the owner and broader community." Later Maps sends notifications to community members, asking to help with these questions. However, many questions that I received were directly addressed to business owners or managers. These questions were started with the combination of words, such as “Do you ….” , “Why don’t you … “, “Are you,,,”, “Aren’t you…”, “Is your …”, etc. How should the community members answer? 
For example, how should I answer the question "Are you open on Monday?". 

Also, I noticed that plenty of asked questions could be quickly and accurately answered by visiting the company web site. Why doesn't Google remind to check the web site prior to asking questions?

Maps lets people to ask questions about places. There is the  option "Ask a question or get advice from the owner and broader community."  in Android Maps and in Web Search.  Then smartphone users, most probably Android only users, receive a notification looking like this:  
Someone has a question about (for example) Home Depot. Could you help? 
Plenty of questions are obviously addressed directly to owners or business managers, because they are started with word combination:  
“Do you ….” , “Why don’t you … “, “Are you,,,”, “Aren’t you…”, “Is your …”, etc. 
I am a part of broader community. Why such questions are coming to me, when they are explicitly directed to owners or managers? 
I don't know what to answer when someone is asking: "Are you open on....?"
I am open everyday (so far)... 

Also,  Google Maps encourages people to ask  broader community or business owners questions regarding the place. However, I found that plenty of questions, that I received, could be quickly answered by visiting the source, company's Wed site. Why does Google not encourage to look at the web site prior to asking? 

~~Another thing. I found that about  third of questions could be answered by few clicks on companies web sites. Why does Maps suggest to “Ask a question or get advice from the owner and broader community” without suggesting to see the company Web site first? ~~
